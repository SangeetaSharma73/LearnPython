# Understanding `*args` and `**kwargs` in Python

Hello! Today, we're going to learn about two special types of arguments in Python: `*args` and `**kwargs`. These are used to pass a variable number of arguments to a function. Let's dive in and understand the differences between them.

## What is `*args`?

`*args` is used to pass a variable number of non-keyword arguments to a function. It allows you to pass any number of arguments to the function, and they will be accessible as a tuple.

### Example of Using `*args`

```python
def print_numbers(*args):
    for arg in args:
        print(arg)

print_numbers(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```

Output:
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

In this example, `print_numbers` can accept any number of arguments, and they are all printed one by one.

### When to Use `*args`

Use `*args` when you want to create functions that can handle a variable number of non-keyword arguments. This is useful when you don't know in advance how many arguments will be passed to the function.

## What is `**kwargs`?

`**kwargs` is used to pass a variable number of keyword arguments to a function. It allows you to pass any number of keyword arguments, and they will be accessible as a dictionary.

### Example of Using `**kwargs`

```python
def print_user_info(**kwargs):
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")

print_user_info(name="Alice", age=10, grade="5th", hobby="Painting")
```

Output:
```
name: Alice
age: 10
grade: 5th
hobby: Painting
```

In this example, `print_user_info` can accept any number of keyword arguments, and they are all printed with their keys and values.

### When to Use `**kwargs`

Use `**kwargs` when you want to create functions that can handle a variable number of keyword arguments. This is useful when you don't know in advance what keyword arguments will be passed to the function.

## Using `*args` and `**kwargs` Together

You can use both `*args` and `**kwargs` in the same function to handle both non-keyword and keyword arguments.

### Example of Using `*args` and `**kwargs` Together

```python
def print_all(*args, **kwargs):
    print("Non-keyword arguments:")
    for arg in args:
        print(arg)
    
    print("\nKeyword arguments:")
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")

print_all(1, 2, 3, name="Alice", age=10, grade="5th")
```

Output:
```
Non-keyword arguments:
1
2
3

Keyword arguments:
name: Alice
age: 10
grade: 5th
```

In this example, `print_all` can accept both non-keyword and keyword arguments and print them separately.

## Summary

- **`*args`**:
  - Used to pass a variable number of non-keyword arguments.
  - Accessible as a tuple.
  - Useful when you don't know how many arguments will be passed.

- **`**kwargs`**:
  - Used to pass a variable number of keyword arguments.
  - Accessible as a dictionary.
  - Useful when you don't know what keyword arguments will be passed.

By understanding the differences between `*args` and `**kwargs`, you can create more flexible and versatile functions in Python. Have fun experimenting with them!
