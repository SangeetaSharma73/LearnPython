#Operators- An operator in a programming language is a symbol that to perform specific operations like arithmetic, logic and decision making

#1.Arithmetic Operators
a=5
b=3
print(a+b)#add
print(a-b)#sub
print(a*b)#mul
print(a**b)#power- a to the power b
print(a/b)#division
print(a//b)#floor- which will give floor value - the result is floored to the nearest smaller integer
print(a%b)#modulo- which will give remainder

#string concatenation
first='hi, '
second='this is sang'
print(first+second) # hithis is sang

print('1'+'1') #11
# print('24'-1)#unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'int'
print(first*3)
# 'hi, ', 'hi, ', 'hi, '
print(-3//2)
