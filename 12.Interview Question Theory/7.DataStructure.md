# Comparison of List, String, Tuple, Set, and Dictionary in Python

Hello! Today, we're going to learn about different data structures in Python: **list**, **string**, **tuple**, **set**, and **dictionary**. These data structures help you store and manage data in different ways. Let's dive in and understand the differences between them.

## List

A **list** is a collection of items that are ordered and changeable (mutable). Lists allow duplicate elements and can contain items of different types.

### Example

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, "apple", "banana"]
print(my_list)
```

Output:
```
[1, 2, 3, 'apple', 'banana']
```

### Key Features

- **Ordered**: Items have a defined order.
- **Mutable**: Items can be changed.
- **Allows duplicates**: Multiple items with the same value are allowed.

## String

A **string** is a collection of characters enclosed in single, double, or triple quotes. Strings are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after they are created.

### Example

```python
my_string = "Hello, world!"
print(my_string)
```

Output:
```
Hello, world!
```

### Key Features

- **Ordered**: Characters have a defined order.
- **Immutable**: Characters cannot be changed.
- **Allows duplicates**: Multiple characters with the same value are allowed.

## Tuple

A **tuple** is a collection of items that are ordered and unchangeable (immutable). Tuples allow duplicate elements and can contain items of different types.

### Example

```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, "apple", "banana")
print(my_tuple)
```

Output:
```
(1, 2, 3, 'apple', 'banana')
```

### Key Features

- **Ordered**: Items have a defined order.
- **Immutable**: Items cannot be changed.
- **Allows duplicates**: Multiple items with the same value are allowed.

## Set

A **set** is a collection of unique items that are unordered and unindexed. Sets do not allow duplicate elements and can contain items of different types.
Set is mutable but their items should be immutable.

### Example

```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3, "apple", "banana"}
print(my_set)
```

Output (order may vary):
```
{1, 2, 3, 'apple', 'banana'}
```

### Key Features

- **Unordered**: Items do not have a defined order.
- **Mutable**: Items can be added or removed, but the set itself is mutable.
- **No duplicates**: Multiple items with the same value are not allowed.

## Dictionary

A **dictionary** is a collection of key-value pairs that are unordered, changeable (mutable), and indexed by keys. Keys in a dictionary must be unique and immutable, while values can be of any type.

### Example

```python
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 10, "grade": "5th"}
print(my_dict)
```

Output:
```
{'name': 'Alice', 'age': 10, 'grade': '5th'}
```

### Key Features

- **Unordered**: Key-value pairs do not have a defined order.
- **Mutable**: Key-value pairs can be changed.
- **Unique keys**: Keys must be unique and immutable.

## Summary

Here's a quick comparison of these data structures:

| Data Structure | Ordered | Mutable | Allows Duplicates | Type of Elements |
|----------------|---------|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| List           | Yes     | Yes     | Yes               | Any type         |
| String         | Yes     | No      | Yes               | Characters       |
| Tuple          | Yes     | No      | Yes               | Any type         |
| Set            | No      | Yes     | No                | Any type         |
| Dictionary     | No      | Yes     | No (keys)         | Key-value pairs  |

By understanding the differences between lists, strings, tuples, sets, and dictionaries, you can choose the right data structure for your Python programs. Have fun exploring these data structures!

- `items()`: Return a new view of the dictionary's items (key, value pairs).
- `keys()`: Return a new view of the dictionary's keys.
- `pop(key[, default])`: Remove the specified key and return the corresponding value. If key is not found, default is returned if given, otherwise KeyError is raised.
