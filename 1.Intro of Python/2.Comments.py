# Python Comments
'''
Comments can be used to explain Python code.
Comments can be used to make the code more readable.

# Creating a Comment
'''
Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:
'''
x=23
# print(id(x))

#comments
#this is a single line comment

# Multiline Comments
'''Python does not really have a syntax for multiline comments.
To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:
'''
#This is a comment
#written in
#more than just one line
print("Hello, World!")


#Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.
# Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable,
# you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:

"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
print("Hello, World!")



# Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line:
print('hello world') #this is a comment



#data types
#int
number=23
print(number)
print(type(number))

#float
n=2.4
print(n)
print(type(n))

#Booleans
b=True
print(type(b))

#strings
s='Rahul 123 @ +'
print(type(s))

s="Rahul 123 @ +"
print(type(s))

#multiline string
a='''
this is the 
multiline string
