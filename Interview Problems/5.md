🧵 What is Threading in ?
Threading is a way to make your program do many things at the same time (or at least appear to). Each thread is like a mini-program running inside your main program.

🎯 Example:
Imagine you're baking a cake and boiling water at the same time. Both tasks are running together instead of one after the other — that's threading!

✅ Why Use Threading?
To make programs faster when doing multiple tasks.

To avoid freezing apps while waiting (e.g., downloading a file and showing a progress bar).

To improve the user experience in apps and GUIs.

⚠️ But Important to Know:
In , the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) prevents multiple threads from running code truly in parallel (but it's okay for I/O tasks like file read/write, web requests, etc.).

📦 How to Use Threading in
✅ Step 1: Import the threading module

import threading
import time
✅ Step 2: Create a Function (Task)

def say_hello():
for i in range(5):
print("Hello from thread")
time.sleep(1)
✅ Step 3: Create and Start a Thread

thread = threading.Thread(target=say_hello)
thread.start()

print("Main program is still running...")
🧠 What Happens Here?
say_hello() runs in a separate thread.

Your main program continues without waiting.

🧪 Real-Life Use Case: Downloading Files

def download_file(name):
print(f"Starting download: {name}")
time.sleep(2)
print(f"Finished download: {name}")

t1 = threading.Thread(target=download_file, args=("File1",))
t2 = threading.Thread(target=download_file, args=("File2",))

t1.start()
t2.start()

t1.join() # Wait for thread 1
t2.join() # Wait for thread 2

print("Both downloads completed!")
🔥 Where is Threading Used?
Downloading files from the internet

Building chat apps

Game development (e.g., background music while playing)

GUI apps to keep them responsive

Real-time data monitoring

🧠 Summary
Concept What It Does
threading module to create threads
Thread() Used to create a thread
.start() Starts the thread (runs function)
.join() Waits for the thread to finish
GIL Only one thread runs code at a time (but OK for I/O)
