# Understanding Shallow Copy and Deep Copy in Python

Hello! Today, we're going to learn about two important concepts in Python: **shallow copy** and **deep copy**. These concepts are related to copying data structures like lists and dictionaries. Let's dive in and understand the differences between them.

## What is a Copy?

When you copy a data structure, you create a new data structure with the same content. However, how the content is copied can vary, leading to shallow and deep copies.

## Shallow Copy

A **shallow copy** creates a new object, but it doesn't create new copies of the objects inside the original object. Instead, it copies references to the objects. This means that changes to the objects inside the copied object will affect the original object and vice versa.

### Example of Shallow Copy

```python
import copy

original_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
shallow_copied_list = copy.copy(original_list)

shallow_copied_list[0][0] = 99

print("Original List:", original_list)
print("Shallow Copied List:", shallow_copied_list)
```

Output:
```
Original List: [[99, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
Shallow Copied List: [[99, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
```

As you can see, changing an element inside the shallow copied list also changes the original list because they share references to the same inner lists.

## Deep Copy

A **deep copy** creates a new object and also recursively copies all objects inside the original object. This means that changes to the objects inside the copied object will not affect the original object and vice versa.

### Example of Deep Copy

```python
import copy

original_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
deep_copied_list = copy.deepcopy(original_list)

deep_copied_list[0][0] = 99

print("Original List:", original_list)
print("Deep Copied List:", deep_copied_list)
```

Output:
```
Original List: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
Deep Copied List: [[99, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
```

As you can see, changing an element inside the deep copied list does not change the original list because they are completely separate copies.

## When to Use Shallow Copy and Deep Copy

- **Shallow Copy**: Use when you want a new object but don't mind if changes to the inner objects affect the original object. It's faster and uses less memory.
- **Deep Copy**: Use when you need a completely independent copy of the original object and don't want changes to the inner objects to affect the original object. It's slower and uses more memory.

## Summary

- **Shallow Copy**:
  - Creates a new object.
  - Copies references to the objects inside the original object.
  - Changes to inner objects affect both the original and copied objects.

- **Deep Copy**:
  - Creates a new object.
  - Recursively copies all objects inside the original object.
  - Changes to inner objects do not affect the original object.

By understanding the differences between shallow and deep copy, you can choose the right method for copying data structures in your Python programs. Have fun copying!
