# Understanding Decorators in Python

Decorators in Python are a powerful and useful tool that allows you to modify the behavior of a function or a class method. They are a way to dynamically alter the functionality of your code. Decorators are often used in scenarios like logging, access control, instrumentation, caching, and more.

## How Decorators Work

A decorator is a function that takes another function (or method) as an argument and extends or alters its behavior. The original function is replaced with a new function that adds some additional behavior before or after the execution of the original function.

### Basic Syntax

A decorator is defined as a function that returns another function:

```python
def decorator_function(original_function):
    def wrapper_function(*args, **kwargs):
        # Additional behavior before the original function call
        print(f'Wrapper executed this before {original_function.__name__}')

        result = original_function(*args, **kwargs)

        # Additional behavior after the original function call
        print(f'Wrapper executed this after {original_function.__name__}')

        return result
    return wrapper_function
```

### Applying a Decorator

You apply a decorator to a function using the `@decorator_name` syntax just above the function definition:

```python
@decorator_function
def display():
    print('Display function ran')

display()

# Output:
# Wrapper executed this before display
# Display function ran
# Wrapper executed this after display
```

### Decorators with Arguments

If you want your decorator to accept arguments, you need to add another level of nesting:

```python
def decorator_with_arguments(arg1, arg2):
    def decorator_function(original_function):
        def wrapper_function(*args, **kwargs):
            print(f'Arguments passed to decorator: {arg1}, {arg2}')
            return original_function(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper_function
    return decorator_function

@decorator_with_arguments('Hello', 'World')
def display_info(name, age):
    print(f'display_info ran with arguments ({name}, {age})')

display_info('John', 25)

# Output:
# Arguments passed to decorator: Hello, World
# display_info ran with arguments (John, 25)
```

### Using `functools.wraps`

When you use decorators, the metadata of the original function (`__name__`, `__doc__`, etc.) is lost. To preserve this metadata, you can use `functools.wraps`:

```python
from functools import wraps

def decorator_function(original_function):
    @wraps(original_function)
    def wrapper_function(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f'Wrapper executed this before {original_function.__name__}')
        result = original_function(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f'Wrapper executed this after {original_function.__name__}')
        return result
    return wrapper_function

@decorator_function
def display():
    """Display function documentation"""
    print('Display function ran')

print(display.__name__)  # Output: display
print(display.__doc__)   # Output: Display function documentation
```

### Class Decorators

Decorators can also be applied to classes:

```python
def decorator_class(cls):
    class WrappedClass(cls):
        def new_method(self, *args, **kwargs):
            print('New method added by decorator')
            return super().new_method(*args, **kwargs)
    return WrappedClass

@decorator_class
class MyClass:
    def original_method(self):
        print('Original method of MyClass')

obj = MyClass()
obj.original_method()
obj.new_method()

# Output:
# Original method of MyClass
# New method added by decorator
```

## Conclusion

Decorators in Python are a versatile tool that can help you modify and extend the behavior of functions and methods. By understanding how decorators work, you can leverage them to write cleaner, more modular, and more maintainable code.

# Understanding Decorators in Python (For Kids)

Hello there! Today, we're going to learn about something cool in Python called **decorators**. Don't worry, I'll explain it in a fun and easy way so you can understand it even if you're 10 years old. Let's get started!

## What's a Decorator?

Imagine you have a special sticker that you can put on your toys. This sticker makes your toys do something extra cool, like glowing in the dark or making sounds. In Python, a decorator is like that special sticker. It adds extra features to your functions (which are like your toys) without changing how they work inside.

## Why Use Decorators?

Decorators are super useful because they help you:
- **Reuse code**: You can use the same decorator on many functions to add the same cool feature.
- **Keep your code clean**: Instead of adding extra code inside your functions, you can use decorators to keep things organized.
- **Add extra behavior**: You can make your functions do extra things before or after they run.

## How Does a Decorator Work?

Let's say you have a function that prints a message. A decorator can add extra behavior to this function, like printing something before and after the message.

### Example Without Decorator

Here's a simple function that says hello:

```python
def say_hello():
    print("Hello, world!")

say_hello()
```

Output:
```
Hello, world!
```

### Adding a Decorator

Now, let's add a decorator to make it more fun. This decorator will print messages before and after saying hello.

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Before the function runs")
        func()
        print("After the function runs")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello, world!")

say_hello()
```

Output:
```
Before the function runs
Hello, world!
After the function runs
```

See how the decorator added extra messages before and after saying hello? That's the magic of decorators!

## How to Create a Decorator

Let's break it down into simple steps:

1. **Create a decorator function**: This function will take another function (let's call it `func`) as an argument.
2. **Create a wrapper function**: Inside the decorator, create a new function called `wrapper`. This function will add the extra behavior.
3. **Call the original function**: Inside the `wrapper`, call the original function (`func`) to keep its original behavior.
4. **Return the wrapper**: Finally, return the `wrapper` function from the decorator.

Here's how it looks:

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Before the function runs")
        func()
        print("After the function runs")
    return wrapper
```

### Using the Decorator

To use the decorator, just add `@my_decorator` above the function you want to decorate:

```python
@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

## Extra Information

- **Multiple Decorators**: You can use more than one decorator on a single function. Just stack them on top of each other.
- **Arguments**: Decorators can also work with functions that take arguments. You just need to use `*args` and `**kwargs` in the `wrapper` to handle any number of arguments.

### Example with Arguments

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Before the function runs")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("After the function runs")
        return result
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

say_hello("Alice")
```

Output:
```
Before the function runs
Hello, Alice!
After the function runs
```

## Conclusion

Decorators are like magical stickers that add extra features to your functions. They help you keep your code clean, reusable, and organized. Now you know how to create and use decorators in Python. Have fun decorating your functions!
